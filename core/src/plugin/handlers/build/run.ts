    Run an ad-hoc instance of the specified build. This should wait until the execution completes, and should ideally attach it to the terminal (i.e. pipe the output from the service to the console, as well as pipe the input from the console to the running service).

    Called by the \`garden run build\` (formerly \`garden run module\`) command.
